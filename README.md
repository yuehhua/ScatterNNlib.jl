## Notice!! This repository is not under maintained. All functionalities have been migrated to NNlib.jl and NNlibCUDA.jl.

A scatter operation library for neural network

## Benchmark

Scatter operations are fundamental to ScatterNNlib.jl and they are implemented in CPU and CUDA version. Benchmarks of scatter operations are done with scripts in benchmark folder. Statistics, includes max, min and mean, are shown in the following plots.
